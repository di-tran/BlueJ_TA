Our product, BlueJ TA, is a BlueJ extension that aids in the learning process by providing
programming exercises for students to complete and verify in real-time. The following 
section describes the elements that as a whole compose our product. Other than the BlueJ 
extension menus, our project was split into three major modules: the JUnit test runner, 
the .xml reader, and the set of graphical user interfaces. We also created some side auxiliary 
artifacts to aid the main project, such as sample exercise files to be shipped with the product 
and a build file to help with the cleaning and jaring of the product.

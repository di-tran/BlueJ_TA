Collection of team meeting notes. Scribe duties were assigned to Josh at the beginning, and then handed off to Di on April 5th, 2015. Notes changed format during this transition, from stenographic format to meeting minutes format. Team meeting notes were taken during the course of weekly team meetings held during class on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2 PM to 4 PM and on Saturdayâ€™s at 2 PM. Google Hangouts was the primary tool used on the Saturday meetings. The following artifact consists of a sample of meeting notes from both the stenographic format and the meeting minutes format.

AGENDA

  to download exercises later.

- Load button implemented
- Deadline has been met.
- Finished brainstorming best / worst moments

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
What’s our project’s name?
How are we deploying our exercises? Inside our jar with BlueJ’s export feature?

TO DO
- Create a project name
- Wei will make a closer for the status update
- Assign agenda item to debug exercise button
- Create a key message based off of our experiences
- Compose Monday status update
- Create agenda
- Assign note taker
- Create a blurb

RAW NOTES

Exercises could be placed in a temp folder / in the jar.
Deploying it separately looks clumsy / unprofessional.
Create an installer? There are tools available
Prebuilt exercises + additional folders?

Troubleshooting compile error (revision 213):
Working as of Thursday night.
Compiler error. Duplicate classes were deleted.
Works after troubleshooting: duplicate classes with no source code.

Options:
- Deployed in jar.
- Deployed separately in their own zip.
- Starter set in jar, additional available for download.

It would be good to make sure the jar exercises are tested & add whatever code is
needed to make it work.

Execute button doesn’t work. Exercise not launched.

Second presentation

Starting key messages / main ideas:
- Morale & how you can improve it (losing / gaining members; exploration / unification)
- Conflicting / Unanimous Decisions: Conflicting decisions split morale; unanimous the opposite
- Lingering decisions affects morale. 
  - Process model
    - Wasn’t considered until asked about
    - Agreed on a concrete process model.
    - Researched process model
  - Chirp / Git reuniting
  - Where to put what in Google Drive before refactoring
  - Final project decision (CodingBat)

- Identify decision making points or areas.
- Hashed a process model that fit our needs, got Jodied. Stopped process model altogether.
  Waited for feedback, listened to concerns and addressed them.
- Being spiral: do a little effort, check for feedback, and continue / backup & reassess

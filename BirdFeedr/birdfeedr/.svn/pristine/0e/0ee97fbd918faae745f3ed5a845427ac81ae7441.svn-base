Design Desisions:

A)Some form of multi threading may be needed to ensure the 
gui's event handling thread dosent lock up on a lengtly or infinite junit proccess.
	-This is currently depicted in the Proposed Design Documesnts(v1).

B)Might want a cancel button or feature to help stop lenglty JUnit processes

C)need to pass JUnit.jar location to the process as well as the curerent jre or jdk location

D)Made JUnitCore run in a process instead of a thread because threads .stop() are depreciated 
and the processes are safer to destry in an infinite state.

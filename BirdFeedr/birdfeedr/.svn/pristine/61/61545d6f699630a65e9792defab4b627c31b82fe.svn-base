User stories created by Team BirdFeedr. We created these stories by answering “If I was a user, I would want the extension to…”. We currently defined a user as someone who wants to do an exercise. We also added a few User stories regarding “Others” who aren’t people that want to do an exercise, but rather wants to create new exercises or other non-exercise related things. The following artifact consists of the user stories generated for project BlueJ TA.

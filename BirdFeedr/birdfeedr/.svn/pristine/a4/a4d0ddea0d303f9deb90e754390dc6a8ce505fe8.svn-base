For some documentation on how the editor works see:
	http://www.bluej.org/download/editor-download.html

Note: 	This is an older version of the editor that I only referenced for the documentation. 
	The mentality on how it works is relatively still the same in newer versions. 
	Also I used a newer version in my test.

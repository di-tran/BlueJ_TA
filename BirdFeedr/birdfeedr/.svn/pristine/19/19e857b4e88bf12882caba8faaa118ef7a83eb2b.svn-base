The following artifact is an image of our issues logged into our Redmine website. Many of the issues logged are from the results of an End-to-End test our team went through at the end of development of our BlueJ TA extension. We performed these tests by going through the entire extension from start to finish, and logged any issues found. These issues are used to keep track of known bugs our program suffers through. Since we do not have any more time to spare, we have these known bugs logged so any future developer knows what to expect to fix.

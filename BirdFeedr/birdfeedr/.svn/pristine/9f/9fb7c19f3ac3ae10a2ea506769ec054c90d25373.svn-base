BEGIN WEI'S NOTES

Agenda:

Each person reports on the progress they made.
Discuss the process model.
If the process model is ready then we can make a final decision to use the model.
Choose a specific presentation topic.
(As time permits) Plan the upcoming week.
Plan the status update message.

Miguel worked on the GUI. Currently fixing a window's compatibility issue.
Created the list area for exercises. 

Nate created basic junit runner, 2 design documents proposals (detailed design of junit runner and Upper level design),
researched compilers in general, and researched how to implement the compiler into a bluej extension.

Thomas got a working xml parser created.

Wei talked to the professors and found out more about individual portfolios, improvements to interpersonal communication, and tying him in more.

Josh and Di worked on the process model together. Created a custom tailored process model for us.
Pulled elements from XP, incremental , and iterative models. Multiple increments for pairs to work on.
Each has an interaction as well. Might include release planning phase from XP later on. Process model is still in draft phase.
Iteration planning includes dividing user stories, prioritizing those tasks, estimates for time for those tasks, select subset of tasks to work on.
iterations after that. Currently missing characteristics in the process model draft at the moment. Process model gives an idea of what group should do.
Di wishes to clean up the model at a later time. Draft right now so it's malleable.

Biggest concern to process models is that it'll leech off our progress instead of help it.

Process model should serve us and not the other way around.

Question: does this affect our overhead?

Nate: if we can run through it and have no issues, then it's a good process model to send in.
Josh: we could just tell jody it's a draft.

Di: Need to spend time as a group to plan out releases and go through the model formally to check for overhead.

Wei: In the short run it'll slow us down, but in the long run it'll help us out.

Thomas: Try it out before making a decision.

Miguel: agrees with Thomas

Tried out process model

Everything needs internal and external verification.

Worked on User story complexity metrics spreadsheet and User Stories.csv

Need a way to synchronize google drive with our SVN.

A way to address user stories dependence with one another.

END WEI'S NOTES

Thomas: Has a working XML parser.
   Just two calls everything else is done internally.
   Easy to integrate and move forward.

Wei: Worked on the repository and the readme's
   We are missing an extension an extension jar.
   Missing ctxt.

Thomas: Class files should not be in repositories.

Josh: Typically we don't include products of the build in the repo.
    The jar file is in +libs folder.

Wei: Show JP the good stuff and bad stuff.
   I talked to him about the individual portfolios.
   Anything that we do could be an artifact including a pic of us at the pub.
   Annotate: this was a team builder and this is why it is important.
     What this is and how it was useful.
   I tested miguel's build and could not get it to work on windows.

Wei: JP said there is no way you could switch projects.
   He expects a result.
   Told him about how everybody is working on something.
   He said wow we are doing a lot of stuff.
   He was happy overall.
   Our biggest issue is communication
   We have hard time communicating to each other.
   Getting ideas to each other's head.
   It sounds like we are jumping to conclusions.
   When I make a decision, then I forget what went processes went into it.
   Conveying a decision w/ more backup.
   I feel like we have a bunch of good ideas well enough.

Josh: If people conveyed their ideas w/ support then would that solve the problem.

Wei: It might create another problem.
   I have been thinking about metrics.
   That will probably be his next question.
   How people see those message.
   It takes us about a week to make 3 decisions.
   Before we were having trouble with this.
   Do the math, it will take us years.

   If we do research for every decision then it will take us too long.

Josh: At least show the reasoning why.

Di: our next item is to discuss the process  model.

  We pulled elements from incremental and iterative process model.

Josh: Incremental means that the project is divided into slice.

Wei: there will be multiple

Josh: Are there any questions?

Di: It gives us an idea what we are going to do and how long we are going 
  to do this for.

  Are there any questions?

Wei: Tangent: Stuff in process model is mainly for others outside to know
  An outsider could be told our status.

Josh: Its a facade of organization.

WeI: Other expect us to do something a stick to it.
  If user stories get cut off then people know why.

Josh: This process model could be improved over time.

Di: event though our process model represents us well.
   If we find that it constrains us then we change us.

Nate: I don't want it to be a leech.

Miguel: This was pretty much what I was thinking.

Thomas: Process model sounds good to me.
     Agrees with Nate.

Di: It should serve us instead of us serving it.

Nate: What is design map?

Josh: Its the one that a Nate and Di came up.

      We could present this to JP as draft.

      The question is how does this process model affect our overhead.

Nate: We are kind of already in the process model already.

Wei: I think we are closer.
     We have not done any of the planning.

Nate: its load and run that we would be working with.

Wei: If we can run through then its a good process model.

Di: I am looking at additional things we would need to do.
   We would need to do the release planning game.
   We would need to time for that and mapping out increments.
   We have informally picked users stories.
   We are kind of all over the place in this process model.
   We have created the prototypes.

Josh: We could just say that the priorities are done and we need to do
   the estimated time.
   and verify with the customer.

Wei: In the long run this would be good, but, it would take additional time
   to orientate.
   We can show JP how long it takes to do each thing.
   It helps us plan time constraints.
   Slow us down in the short run.

Thomas: We can theorize but not actually.

Miguel: Agrees w/ Nate.

Josh: Would you like to use it for.

Di: Can you define that.

Josh: Nate, what does that mean?

Nate: Try it out.

Di: so this means that we would need to estimate user stories and verify
  that with customer on monday.

Josh: Should we run through the agenda.

Wei: Yes.

Nate: Yes.


Josh: The plan
  - send the process model draft to JP.
  - Monday we do the planning.

Wei: Status Update.
  - Josh would be the speaker.
  - We created a draft for the process model.
  - Miguel created the list area for the exercises in the GUI.
    --Has an 
  - Nate created JUnit runner.
    --Researched compilers and integration.
  - Thomas researched XML parsing.
  - Wei talked to professor about inv portfolios and interpersonal communication.
  - Wei learned about how tabulation can affect views on different computers.
  - Di, Josh worked on the process model drafts.
  - As a team, we learned about team process model.
  - Nate made proposal design documents.
     -i.e. a detailed design of the JUnit runner and an upper level design
      of the project w/ conenctions betweeen components.
  - Thomas created a demo or the XML parser.
    --prototype.
  - Wei created an the root readme draft.

Di: Lets call a break.
   3:30?

Josh: WE will send an email to JP saying this is draft process model.

Nate: Running through exposes errors and removes ambiguity.

Wei: Finished the readme and will close the readme. It will be committed.

Josh: In the release planning, we estimate th time per story and justify it.

Di: Check out Nate's design.

Di: Should we map the components to the user story.
   Tally up components for users stories.

Josh: So user story of selecting exercises gets a score of 5.

Josh: Internal verification means that a nother member of the team verifies.
      External verification means JP verifies.

Di: Evaluate each user stories invidually w/o the context of the other story.

Josh: For each one lets think about how we can test these.

Josh: We should have parrellel SVN and Google Drive folders.

Nate: I am fine with that.

Josh: Confused about As a user, I want to see examples of the exercises.

Josh: I get an error javafx.Application not found.
  So apparently the JavaFX is not in the +libs.

Josh: The purpose of this activity was to give our test.

Wei: The exercise loaders have already

Nate: is this activity helping us.

Wei: Yes, because we can see how these stories move together
   and dependencies.

Miguel: I think this is helpful. We can see what needs to be done.

Josh: Our process model needs a way to address user stories dependencies.
   There is no documentation specifying dependencies.

Wei: I have dependecies in the Justification.

Josh: It might be nice to give each user story an ID.

Wei: The highest prioty is one b/c it is the largest and other user stories
  depend on and the ID is #1.
     Its the most independent user story.

Miguel: Agrees w/ Wei.

Nate: A good way to priotize would be to walk up a user scenario.

  Thus, ID #1 would be first.

Josh: Does our process model tell us what comes next.

Nate: will we do more than user story at a time.

Josh: Yes. b/c of incrementation.

Wei: All of them are based off #1.
    #1 is independent.
    #2 is based on #1
    #3 is based on #1,6

Nate: I think everything is dependent on #2 but #1.
      and #2 depends on #1

Josh: so #6 is priority b/c users want feedback.

Wei: #4,5 are like the icing and they may be done towards the end.
    #3 is stuff on the GUI.
    #1 is working inside the GUI.

Nate: Priotization has been based on user preference.
   Alt prioritation would be risk and time.

Nate: so we did release planning minus customer verification.
  It took a little long b/c of confusion
  but those may be ironed out.

Wei: Orientation to the process model can slow us down.

Josh: If we did send verify the result of the release planning
  then we would send him a list of user stories w/ their estimated times.
  in a sorted order. We would tell him what subset we would be working on.

Nate: so on Monday, we would be testing Increment planning.

Wei: say that we have a draft and we will see if it works in our favor.

Nate: I would like to try and use that with current project.

Josh: in the mean time we could use tasks to organize what we will do.

Josh: We would have to manage JP's expectations if our process models.
     changes.

Wei: we should we reiterate that we are making progress in other areas
  as well.


Nate: It would be nice to have aproduct by spring break.

In this meeting we tested th release planning phase of our formal process model.

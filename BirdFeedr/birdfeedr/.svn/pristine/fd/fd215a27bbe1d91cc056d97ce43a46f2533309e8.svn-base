This collection of team meeting notes were created at every team meeting. Scribe duties were assigned to Josh at the beginning, and then handed off to Di on April 5th, 2015. The notes changed format during this transition, from a stenographic format to meeting minutes format. Team meeting notes were taken during the course of weekly team meetings held during class on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2 PM to 4 PM and on Saturdays at 2 PM. Team meeting notes allowed team members to revisit and recall decisions and issues discussed in previous meetings. The following artifact consists of a sample of meeting notes from both the stenographic format and the meeting minutes format.

JP: How are you tagging releases?

Josh: Typically there is a trunk?
  We never discussed tagging.

JP: You seem to make decisions w/o considering implications.
  Think more about who the users were.
  In agile, tools you need to be looked into further.


  Liked the purpose.
  I get you are not trying to hold us to this.
  Its unclear that this defines what increments means.
  Okay with that b/c of definitino
  Unsure when we get to the process model.
  What is the out come of project planning?

Di, Wei: User stories, Vision, and Definition.

JP: Project planning: you define the stories once.

Di: According to the document it does look like we do the user stories once.
   But we wanted to add and change the 

JP: The whole thing is linear. Where is XP is a circle.
   How do we know that this matches?
   Consider what you are doing?
   What are you doing that is different than CS1 students that demonstrates
    knowledge of engineering?

Josh: So you are looking at the disconnect b/t our custom process model
    and what you are actually doing?

JP: Start w/ something that you believe in.
   Find attributes that you can use.
    Its too grand.
   Just do things that demonstrate best practices.
   You don't have time to invent new stuff.
   Worth doing so we can get to this discussion.

Josh: So we can say we use test first development.

Di: SO yes. Design based on outcomes.
  Identify a small set things.
  Ensure you were adhering.

Josh: so I feel like this was education.

  The core is what we need to get where we wanted to go.

  We could split user stories into tasks.

Thomas: exercise object.
   (demoing)
   Easily integratable.

Nate: Shows that we may compile a string.
  Not sure if we could get stack trace.

Thought: need to determine insertion point.

JP: How is this going to integrate.

Nate: Problem: relies on the calling thread.
   so what if the user does an infinite loop.

JP: You might get resistance from educators who want students to see the
  whole thing.
   Highly entrenched 
   They might write you off.
   I am thinking of even greater success.
   Your project as it lives on afterwards.
   Acknowledge that we did not have time to address this issue
   Now the people are happy b/c they are heard.

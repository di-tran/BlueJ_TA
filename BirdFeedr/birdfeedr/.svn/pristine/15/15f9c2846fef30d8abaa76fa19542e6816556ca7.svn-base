Last Saturday
 - Our group met to discuss the results of each person's work
   and it seems that everyone made progress.
 - We showed our process model draft
 - We exercised the release planning phase of the process model draft.
 - We prepared a status report for monday.

Monday
 - I gave the status report.
 - We heard the tiger team's presentation.
 - We did Thomas's demo and Nate's demo.
 - Nate's demo caught the attention of JP.
 - We walked through the process model and JP said it was too much.
 - Instead, he recommends just specifying what we do that is different
   from what early students would do.

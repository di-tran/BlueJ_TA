Great project.

Positive feedback on our Team Name.
Positive feedback on our vision statement.
Positive feedback on our Project choice.

Our extension relatively debugged.
We have tested it accrossed platforms.


In conclusion,
we have put in a lot of man hours this semester
to produce a product
that functions on various platforms.
For future teams,
we have left the product well documented
and in a ready state
During the course of this semester,
we have put use the practices of software engineering.
Finally,
our primary stake holder has give us positive feedback 
on the various aspects of our work.

\smallskip
We have a product that works on OSX, Windows, and Linux.
Our product comes with several sample exercises that demonstrate
its features.
Plus,
the product has the allows users to point the extension 
to custom exercises.

\smallskip
The project has been left in a ready state
and that means that the product's
source code has been well documented
to enable future teams to understand the code.
We have also documented the bugs
in our project management tool.
External topics have also been covered by our documentation
such as retrospective process models,
email threads,
team building experiences,
and so furthe.

\smallskip
Software engineering practices have been put to use
during the course of the semester.
For example,
we used user stores to focus our team on important features.
We also put use entrepreneurial practices.
For example,
we created a vision statement to focus our team on a dream for the future.

\smallskip
Our primary stake holder has given us positive feedback on our work.
For example,
Dr. Paul said that our vision statement was "well crafted."
He also liked our team name
because he said it was "trademarkable."
He also seemed to like our product
based on his reaction to the product.

\smallskip
Overall,
we feel successful about our work on the project
over the course of this semester.

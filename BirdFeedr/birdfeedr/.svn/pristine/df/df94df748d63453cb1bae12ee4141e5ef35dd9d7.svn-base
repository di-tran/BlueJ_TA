Project Java Interpreter
Time Estimate: 2 Weeks.
Relevance: High
Difficulty: Easy

There is already a Java interpreter online and its source code is on Github. I tried to compile it and I got it to work. I think this extension could really help people over come barriers to programming in Java.

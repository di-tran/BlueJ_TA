Issues/Bugs

- What if user closes BlueJ, then opens it. The project they are working on last will open (and exercise from extension) 
	but extension won’t know it an exercise?

- Currently does not have a proper way to find the XML file directories.
	(using the BlueJ getUserConfigDir() does not return proper path)

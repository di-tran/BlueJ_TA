Regarding licenses…
JP: When you do work for a class, who owns the work? When you do work for a university, who owns the work?
Who owns copyright for a class assignment that was created with university resources?
What is a professor allowed to do with your IP (final exam answers, etc.)
Who owns the IP when something is created in the class?

Only issue is the non-commercial example: if another group of students extends our
current extension and those students have a grant, and MSUDenver likes it and wants to
charge a fee to do that, but they can’t b/c of licensing fees - is that right?

Do all team members have to agree when granting copying permissions?
Or is it individual control?

Most BlueJ extensions can be decompiled with the Windows Debugger.

Presentations on copyright? Message would be “Should you copyright your school property?”
J: Take care to deliver this pres
T: Message can come out of research
J: Let’s try to stick to one idea so we don’t move in a circle of ideas that returns to the first idea.

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

TO DO
- Hard copy of portfolio to be laid out
- Josh will find an easier way to assemble the portfolio, a plan ‘a.’
- Create key message before talking to Jody
- Make checklist of where BlueJ TA is compared to our user stories, on white board.

RAW NOTES

J: Concerned about not enough manhours to complete everything.
   Might need java files in project, or just need to say there will be code that makes mapping.
W: Scope was to ‘load an exercise’ and ‘do an exercise’
J: 
W: Physical copy to be created, stacked into a PDF. Hard copies to be
N: Are we writing it out on pen?
W: No, we’re going to print it out. Easier to print everything and assemble everything out afterwards.
J: Could be a plan b, I might be able to find a better idea

W/D Flesh presentation
T/M/N/J Refactoring / Parser Integration 

Check in:
Decided to create a presentation about stakeholders. 

J: So this is about outsourcing decision making
D: No, we made the decision

J: No tangible progress - I made a revision on install file for windows (on up yet).
  I’ve been looking at howing to refactor it
N: You’re learning the gaps.

M: Project compiles now on Nate’s but not mine.
W: I feel like a lot of our issues are based off building. Make a release folder and put jars in them.

J: Thomas can you start checklist and then we can finish it?
T: I can start it.

T: For user stories that haven’t been satisfied, ‘does the framework for it exist’ becomes the next question.

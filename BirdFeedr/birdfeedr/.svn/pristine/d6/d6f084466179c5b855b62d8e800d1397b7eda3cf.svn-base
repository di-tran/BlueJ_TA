Exploration Summary: Team Chirp
Jan. 29th, 2015

SUMMARY OF KNOWLEDGE LEARNED:
- BlueJ’s API is composed of events and listeners: if a certain event happens,
  a listener can be implemented to find the event.
- The API has a CompileListener interface and a CompileEvent class.
- BlueJ’s default path for finding files differs depending on the OS it is installed on:
  - In Windows, it defaults to its install directory
  - In OSX, it defaults to the user’s home directory
  - Use bluej.getSystemLibDir() and bluej.getUserConfigDir() to obtain 
    the system’s default library directory and user config directory respectively.
  - To obtain an absolute path to the library’s directory, use:
    bluej.getSystemLibDir().getAbsolutePath() 

EXTENSION VERSIONS:
1. Implementation of SimpleExtension
2. Creates JBox upon successful compile
3. Creates JBox and plays designated .wav file upon successful compile

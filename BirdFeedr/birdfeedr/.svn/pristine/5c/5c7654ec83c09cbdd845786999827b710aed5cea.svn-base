
1) Create jar
To run create a jar from the project, note JUnit does NOT need to be included anymore with the new runner, 
and place it in the ext folder.


2) Copy folders
Copy the "BlueJCodingBat_Resources" folder to the local user folder/bluej found by bluej 
with: blueJ.getUserConfigDir().


3) setup the junit test class
Compile the AddTest.java with the Adder.java with a classpath set to a junit.jar. 
Delete the Adder.class and move the AddTest.class to the "BlueJCodingBat_Resources/Temp" folder
for a test to be seen by the runner.


4) Run a demo project
To run open the DemoTestA project or make a new project with a class called adder in it with an 
add method. Load any exercise(the loading is isn't tied to the runner/compiler yet) and run the 
test on it.

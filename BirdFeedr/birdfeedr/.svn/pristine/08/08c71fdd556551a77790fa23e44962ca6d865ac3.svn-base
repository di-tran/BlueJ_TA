Design Desisions:

A)Some form of multi threading may be needed to ensure the 
gui's event handling thread doesn't lock up on a lengthy or infinite junit process.
	-This is currently depicted in the Proposed Design Documents(v1).

B)Might want a cancel button or feature to help stop lengthy JUnit processes

C)need to execute process with current jre or jdk location,

D)probably make execution process reference a jar to do it.

E)Made JUnitCore run in a process instead of a thread because threads .stop() are depreciated 
and the processes are safer to destroy in an infinite state.

Miguel: Looked an example on design patterns.

SOURCE: http://www.oodesign.com/

---
Miguel: Use a specific design pattern.

Wei: These should convey our message.

Nate: I found a good website.


Wei: A design pattern has consequences.
  Has parts: the name, the problem -- when, elements and correlation,
    consequence

Possible messages:
  - Simplify complexity.
  - Choose the positive trade off.

Wei: You cannot use an object oriented design pattern for a functional language.
Di: You want to use a design patterns to solve reoccuring problems.

Wei: Use design patterns in the design phase instead of the coding phase.
  Design patterns should make coding easier.
  Important part of implying design patterns is knowing your problems.
  The more time we spend with design patterns the easier it is code.

Nate: They are like math formulas.
  It will reduce work and simplify communication.

Know your problem before choosing a design pattern. - More problem analysis.
Design patterns can reduce work later if picked correctly. - Would involve statistics.

Message:
Know your problem before choosing a design pattern.

Agenda:
 - Presentation.
 - Demonstrate the project.
 - Create status message.

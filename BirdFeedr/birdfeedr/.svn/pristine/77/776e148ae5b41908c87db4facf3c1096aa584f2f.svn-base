Communication was essential to the success of our group.
We practiced four communication methods regularly and they were Meeting Summaries, Status Updates, online team meetings, and regular internal email.
Each of these methods supported our group in different ways.
The meeting summaries helped us remember what progress we made during meetings.
The status updates were sent to our professor and helped him understand the progress we made.
The online team meetings facilitated rapid communication and were used to make decisions.
Further, online meetings were used to pair program.
For example, we used an online meeting to debug a cross platform bug that was stalling our extension on a Mac.
All our communication methods were essential to our success.

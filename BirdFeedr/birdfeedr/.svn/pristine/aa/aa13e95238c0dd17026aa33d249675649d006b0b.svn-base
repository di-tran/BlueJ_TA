Latex is a tool for manufactering documentation.
It is widely used for technical or scientific documents.
It is like HTML because the author can create content of the document
and use formatting codes to control the way the text will be displayed.
Thus, it easy to version control.
Also, just like HTML it can include other documents like PDFs
and JPEGs.

Latex was used in this project to create the project notebook.
A screen shot below shows how LaTex code looks.

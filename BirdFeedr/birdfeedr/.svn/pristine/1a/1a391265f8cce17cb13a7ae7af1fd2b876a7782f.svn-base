W
I read patch notes first. We should include them.

T
Use TTB - Trunk tags branchs

W
Take messages from log possible?

T
Manually

J
— I can do it —

W
Doing this gives us a metric.
We should keep a stable version

T
TTB takes care of that.

J
So we’re waiting for ‘if you can get a draft presentation done as a presentation.’

JP
Yes, then you’re asking audience to watch presentation twice.
You can prepare part of it as a full presentation, and then compress it in the final.
But theres limited value in presenting a draft, except for you.
Question for you, aprchitecture wise:
I know you have a custom xml parser. Are you still doing that?

T
Yes

JP
My concern is (not from class perspective, but maintainence perspecitve) I have to maintain it.
I’d prefer, even if it was overkill, to use library routines, even if they weren’t as good.
That way I won’t have to maintain it.
But I have no qualms from a class perspective

W
? Hard copy?

JP
Not necessary, but should be easily transferrable to a hard copy.
Navigable. Tabs maybe. Needs to be straight forward.

J
Difference between notebook / portfolio

JP
One is a track of personal contribution to learning, with reflections on contributions & learning associated with this course.
Other is a documented process for the team personally.
You also have the product which is fully documented.
What is you, and what is the team?
Artifacts can be shared between the three deliverables.

D
Wei will cover me.
(Wei)

N

W
I agree. Need to do more documentating, esp. if we split up the work.
We should also answer those two questions.

J
I think we can always document later.
Our deadline for end of week is load feature, & redesign and document.

N
Nothing funner than deleting a method.

(getting miguel & thomas up to date)

J
What if we could do two presentations. Take a piece of our pres in prep for our final pres.
Thomas, you 

T
The only svn refactoring would be going to ttb.
Where the files go to? That’s a minor issue compared to how they’re deployed?

W
Inside the jar?

J
You can put anything in the jar and there’s alos a way to read files in the jar.

W
Tests stored inside the jar can’t be changed easily.

T
Exercise file shouldn’t change after package.

J
Exercise should be duplicated from extension, so it can be reset.

W
This won’t cause the caching issue, right? 
(no)

T
Keep in jar, reference in jar, solves those problems.

W
Jar just needs to be installed.

J
Even easier than that … it doesn’t matter. You can do it eiter way.
We don’t have to worry about that quite yet.
Start working on that and then redesign, etc.

W
Prioritize the deadline. Everything after that is cleanup.

J
This should be feasible. By Wednesday, we can get it done.

W
Can’t get it done, I have tests.

J
Split into pairs.

W
Two pairs, one on each question. Come back and share what was found.

N
Two groups of 3? Or 2 groups of 2 and one group for pres

W
We can’t do the draft thing anymore.

J
Still want to do the 15th.
People that are busy this week can work on pres.
Di and Wei on pres.
Josh & Nate on load button
Miguel & Thomas on exercise location.

W
Vision statement
How to make a BlueJ extension
Your audience and you?
Meet back at 2:50
Come back at 3.

(recess)

D

T
4 & 5 go together.
2 is extremely risk

N
Out of left field.

M
1 & 5

N
I recommend 5, it’s fresher.

T
1 is narrower.

W
Team meetings I like more. We’ve been doing them more often.
Vision statements are one time thing.
It did help us, but not fresh enough.



W
Much of it can be applied to the final presentation

T
Vision is more applicable.

M
Vision has hard time with content

W
— make to do list —

JP
Clearly you’re providing a build that builds outside of bluej
You’re going to provide an outside xml file.. right?

W
We should try to work around 6

T
Refactor should solve

M
To change it you have to reinstall
You can check extension api and see if compatible with this version

W
Make popup that invalidates it.

T
Refactorable with 1.6
I don’t know how familiar you are with annotating java.
It’s just changing from using a scanner to putting annotations inside object
If you put an-, and unmartial, you can map them out.

W
Progress on two questions?

T
Starting to look into bluej preferences where we can read in uri or path.
TGoes towards grand scheme of ex. in public location

W
Already built in.
What happens after load?

N
Not yet.

M
Another issue.
Let’s say they load an exercise, close BlueJ and open it.
exercise will still be there, but bluej won’t know that it’s an exercise.
When you load, they will createa new project.

W
If we’re able to, we can call a class with specific clas sname.
If we call by class name

M
It would save

W
Best option to clear exercise?

M
Best option is to save it somewhere and save the path.
It’d be annoying to keep pointing to that location.

T
We could also define constraints, make it  clear that when you close bluej, it’s cleaned.

N
terminate feature delets the project, solves that problem.

M
What if it’s a big exercise? Can’t reload it.

T
Given the amount of time, we could just clear it.
We could go back later and have someone save it.

W
It’s out of our scope.

M
Still good to know.

W
Create a button that says ‘this is an exercise’, which restarts the process and makes it become an exercise button. This is out of scope.

Decision:
Document that the problem exists, and is in the backlog.

W
As a reflection, how did you like split and return

T
I like it, lets us tackle more issues together.

W
Lots of decisions made today.
1. Pres topic
2. ‘Exercise state lost’ bug
3. Exercise location defined by user.

J
I am working on trying to get extension to compile for 1.6. Fulfilled.

N
When do we refactor? After these features are done.

T
I estimate a half hour for the parser. Could take me longer because I’m used to martialling first.

W
Whole thing could take up to monday 13th. 

J
What are we doing between now and wednesday?

W
DW doing pres
T M doing prefs pane. 
NJ doing load button.

T
Who wants to learn annotations?
I can refactor parser in my sandbox.

Decision:
Load button will follow Nates diagrams in his sandbox.

— Wei & Di come up with a message.

Wednesday’s Agenda
- review nate’s load button
- progress
- report to stakeholder about progress and what we’re expecting

2015-04-06 15:48

Di's talk:
So the thing we have to cover today is the 2 questions:
Where do the exercise live?
What happens after clicking the Load button?

Lots of documenation work to do.
Personally don't feel like it's there yet.

Acheive those 2 questions then doing documentation, portfollio, project notebook.

presentation ideas:

1. making a vision statement.
2. presentation on presentations. High risk High reward
3. knowing your target demographics. Knowing stakeholders
5. defining goals and success.
5. Team meetings

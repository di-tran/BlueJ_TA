Thomas: likes the idea of codeback.

Wei: the only problem is the scope.

Thomas: we scope it down.

   We set a framework of repository.
   Instructors could load exercises and communicates with that.
   A file system where you drop exercises.
   We define how the exercises are built.
   We have backend of how the exercises are built.


Wei: Instructors make JUnit tests and we make a small framework.

Thomas: define an XSD that professors stick.
  Define a base framework.

JOsh: it should be simple enough so that someone who knows how to use
 a computer can use it.

Everybody like the idea.

Thomas: We have to scope it down.

  Professors can add tests.
  Testing our framework needs more than one test.

Thomas: scoping is our biggest risk.
  Before that our biggest risk was finding a project JP likes.
  We have full control over scope.
  Our previous risk we have no control over.

Josh: We are being more more direct.
  

Goals:
 Scope the project down.
 Integrating into bluej.
 Deck of cards.

Wei, Thomas: Deck of cards.
 

JOsh: what teachers see.

Thomas: rights and priviledges.
     do an exervicse.

UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

RAW NOTES
T: Do we need to print ALL of our team meeting notes? Print 2 - 3 from beginning, middle & end?
Biggest thing to be done is to run through the source code and check commenting, and to do some testing. Weâ€™ve done spawn tests, but not full in testing. 

Testing: D/W
Presentation: T/N
Artifact Collection: M/J

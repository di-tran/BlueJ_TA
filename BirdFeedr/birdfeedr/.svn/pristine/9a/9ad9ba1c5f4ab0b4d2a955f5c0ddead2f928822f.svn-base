Agenda:
- Discuss backend design

Josh
I feel like we’ve made good progress. 

W
You guys just checking out the new Junit runner?
(yes)
J
Noticed minor exemptions, but a result of build. 
What we need to do is make an easy build system. 
General design of classes could be … 
For example, some things hardcoded in state manager. 

N
Tried swapping them with BlueJ calls already.

J
We proved that it works, let’s make everything more abstract.
Refactoring is our next step.
Lots of magic numbers.
Make clean, beatuifl, error free code. Clean up the build.

W
Maybe apply checkstyle?
(sure)

J
Apply design patterns too, maybe?
When it’s loading exercises, should load from inside jar / local repo / etc. 
Don’t implement that, but make design abstract enough that it can transition there.

W
Could use design patterns like wrappers for future implementations.

J
Let’s not rely on design patterns; let’s just clean it up.

W
A lot of stuff has been hardcoded - it had to be demoed.
After demo we should clean this stuff up.
Should be able to refactor it.

J
Let me show you guys something (screenshared)
If I create a jar in bluej, and check “include bluej project files’ and I make that jar..
It will actually take a while, because it will process a 15MB file. 
But what I get is a jar file that includes lots of files.
When it finishes itll be 6MB
We’ll include everything like this .ctxt files, .bat files, .xml and even +libs folders.
So this means if there’s a resource that you need access to, just put it in the jar and
load it internally.
Be aware of this feature & how we can use.

W
How do you want us to use it?

J
If there’s a file the extension needs to refer to, include it in the project folder
and check ’include bluej project files’ to refer to it.
For example, resources folder can be included if copied into proj. dir., bluej will make 
jar including that folder

N
Disadvantage, can’t dynamically include more xml files

J
Need abstraction to make that work

W
We have prebuild exercises & external folder to create exercises?

J
No, I want to redesign and have it flexible enough to do both. 
All included exercises live in jar.
And maybe have a way to change repos.

W
Probably won’t get done tbh
Have a few pre built exercises & load from repository.
Should be able to do this with a redesign.

J
We’re not implementing it.

W
Just refactoring to implement in the future.

Have an idea about exercise locations.
Create a preference document, like in games, that saves preferences like where files would
be loaded from.
It could keep records of previously completed exerices.
Out of scope but possible

J
Yes

N
BlueJ includes it.
setextensionpropertystring() - sets property of extension into bluej repository.

J
That was my findings. Anyone else want to report theirs

W
Thinking about what happens after load.
After putting load button, GUI pops up to load new exercise or new exercise
Lets them go back or refresh whole exercise.

J
Sounds cool

W
Might not happen right after load. Would be good as a tools option.
In same dropdown menu, as an option. 
Might be out of scope, but follows load user story.
Exercise location: aside from being inside our jar, could be in a local directory.
In light of OSX/Windews differences… have code check OS before creating dir

J

N
ExtensionPathGen

W
Create own dir. inside user/BlueJ wihch says ‘exercises’, loaded in there.
pull from that folder specifically, and load it. If not, create new one.
(liked)

J
Not a lot on my plate, but what about everyone else?

W
Algorithms test, psychology test, econ test all in this week. + This class.
Should be free after this monday.

D
Directing. Plan rehearsals mondays / fridays. Will have this on plate through end of semester

N
Pretty free. Have a rigid bodies class, kind of easy. Test on monday.

J
Did you guys hear anything from others?

W
Miguel might have calc 3 test, can’t say for sure.

N
Report on what I’ve done:
main concern - project can load and execute exercises.

W
na load through xml but hows test on junit runner? 

N
Not caching anymore.
Runner should work if setup crrectly. Not tied to loading exercises at all.
Has to be hoardcoded and in a specific spot.
That part of backend - takes xml and makes a spot of junit to see - needs to be created.
JUnit runner integrated, and design ideas proposed in the sandbox. 
A little worried about the understanding of how this works is lacking; lack of bluej apis knowledge.

W
Tried looking for bluej accessors to junit

N
Runner uses BlueJ’s Junit jar. No need for manifest changes.

J
Worried that members don’t understand BlueJ API and how the code works?
(Yeah)

D
I can attest to that.

W
A lot of it has to be connected to javafx. Many classes are javafx handiling.

N
GUIs and FXML are all 1-1, and actions are one to one. Every GUI has execute action.

W
Do you know a better way to do that?

N
Might be able to bake them in teh calsses as privates stacti. Will still exist, but not a node.

J
Since everybody’s busy… what if the busy people shift to the presentation?
It could take a lot of work, but maybe if everybody has something to do, let’s put on a 
presentation.
Less work for all those people; more free people to design.
Next presentation date undecided.

W
Can last presentation be a draft for the final?

J
That could be our EC presentation to get feedback.

W
We could do that.
Presentation on vision statement?

J
Vision Pres
Draft Pres

N
Time. 6 weeks?

D
4 weeks. Everything is due the 4th.

J
All of this month.

N
Worried about manhours. Presentations + notebooks + projects = lot of time.

J
Others might have time. I do. Nate does. Wei will. It’s plausible. Shoot for vision pres
on 15th.
Then present final pres on 29th for feedback.

W
Regardless, we have to do the final. Doing it right before allows feedback.
Regardless of manhours & metrics, it still needs to be done.

J
Would be doing an extra presentation as extra credit. 
How much to gain if we do this?

W
It would be good to practice.

D
Would this be approved?

J
What about last wednesdays pres.

N
I imagine final one to be about the final product.

J
I’d like to talk to him too.

W
I can swing by his office and ask about that.

J
Also ask for final pres advice.

D
Is everyone passionate about vision pres?

W
Even a left field pres would be okay as long as we’re passionate about it.

J
Our presentation should be something we relate to in a personal way.
ie here are some pointers.

D
Vision statements stems from our personal experience.

W
How about BlueJ extension presentation?
— I can make a draft. —

D
What’s next?

J
I wanted to get a feel for why we weren’t productive. 
In our status we should say we were busy and didnt produce a lot of stuff.
So that’s what we should do in our status.

D
what should our client expect

J
Our decision was to spend time redesigning.
There are some issues that we can cover.
That’s our direction

N
not a design issue because it doesnt exist yet.
what happens fater load button pressed doesnt exist.
no class that does anything.

J
Do we clean it up or design a load or do both?

N
At the end of the semester, I really want to make it run and demo-able.

D
I want to do both, but is that possible given our time

W
Yeah, but it depends on our time investment. Must be cleaned before adding more stuff..

N
Can be modulized. Someone can work on it while someone else cleans it up.

W
Risky - cleaning things up neglects the knowldege of the module. 
Need prior info of the module.

J
How much more code would it take to create this load feature module?

W
One or two classes.

N
It wouldn’t be that much since compiler exists - would be part of that module
Main issue is knowing waht to do. 
Knowing what the module ..
Wouldn’t take effort if you knew what to do.

J
Needs some research.

N
One line of code = 5 hours, as an example possibly.

J
Proposal: 11th to get load button working.

N
I like deadlines. (not sarcastic)

W
Currently, load button just loads exercises. What else should it do.
Gui is making menu from xml files.
Used to be able to, from state manager, remember loaded exercises.

J
Miscommunication?

N
Loads exercise, does nothing with it. Doesn’t create a new project.
Doesn’t do anything that benefits the junit runner.

W
Seeing as how a lot of people are busy, the 11th is a good deadline. 

J
If we finish early, clean it up.
The 11th is for a ready state. 

W
I made a draft / outline of our project notebook.
For personal portfolio, hard copy needed? & Project notebook, pdf needed?

J
Another thing to ask Jody. Notebook or portfolio a physical copy?

W
11th deadline good for mentoring new people into code roles.
will make a list of concerns, to place on GDrive. Under team documentation
-> Things to consider.



J
Who wants to take circle notes on monday?

W
Two scribes? Notes can be compared and merged, and allows conversations.
Redundant. But like big brother.
Scribe and scriber’s scribe (only notes scribe’s speech).

N
Assignment of scribes as part of agenda.

MONDAYS AGENDA

The JUnit Runner is a subset of code in BlueJ TA that runs a compiled JUnit test with 
a variety of dynamically created user classes. This is done by using the JUnitCore 
run feature from the JUnit API within BlueJ's user VM. Along with other elements of the
project this aspect of BlueJ TA evolved over many different iterations to fix bugs 
and accommodate changes in requirements.

The following artifacts consists of the code that encompasses JUnit Runner.

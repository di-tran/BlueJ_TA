Project Chirp is a completed BlueJ extension that will cause BlueJ to play a chirping sound when a user compiles a file. During this project, the team learned several interesting quirks about BlueJ. For instance, we learned that BlueJ will store files in different locations depending on the OS. We also discovered that BlueJ provides CompileEvents and CompileListeners in their API. The following artifact consists of a sample of the source code created for Project Chirp.

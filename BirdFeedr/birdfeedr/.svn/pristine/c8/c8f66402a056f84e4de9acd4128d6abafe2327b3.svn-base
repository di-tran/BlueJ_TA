Our team used a number of tools to facilitate our project.
We selected our tools because they were reliable, supported, 
and we had expertise.
There were other tools that we voted down like Git.
Although Git is an excellent tool for version control,
we voted it down because we did not have expertise
and we would have to wait while this tool was set up.

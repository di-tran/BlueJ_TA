Chirp: met and implemented the example extension.
  Created another extension to pull up JOption Pane.
  Ran into a small problem with windows.

Github: Release planning and iteration planning.

---
Wei: go over what went well and what did not work well.


  Peer programming worked well b/c they could get information
    accrossed quickly.

Di: Liked how we were iterating.
   Felt like we were making progress until they hit user directories.
  More design. How to design the extension in general.
  Spend more time on design.

Nathan: Liked the progress. Jumping into it.
  Did not like the slopping code.
  Spend more time cleaning the code up and organizating it.


Josh: where did you make the most progress?

Di: outside of class. Met the day after.


Josh: I liked learning about XP.
      I liked learning about Refactoring, JavaGit, JGit.

Miguel: Could have spent more time on the project.

Wei: More time outside of class.

Thomas: We spent time in class working on the extension.

Josh: anything else.

Wei: I don't think there is anything else.


Questions:

How is the process model of each subgroup shown in the notebook?

Josh: We don't want to wait till the last minute to work on the notebook.

Wei: Keeps a personal notebook and records decisions.
  Push that into our documents folder like a project journal.
  Subgroups keep their own Journal.
  
Josh: Di you want to add to that?

Di: How are we going to document this?
  If we are can ship jar files then add the thinking process for each.
  It would be better to work on project notebook.

Josh: Miguel anything?


Miguel: Nope.

Nathan: We are not following a process model.
   Getting to know the process models.
   Process model is not concrete.

Wei: Closest process model is closet to Agile.

Nathan: Purpose of process model is to complete a project.
   If we spend more time on process model than on the actual work
     then it is like a leach.

Wei: Choose the process model that works for us.
  It helps us when we don't know what to do.

  We start working and choose the process model that fits us.
  We are trying to be philosopher.


Josh:  I think this has 

Josh: Let the project Chirp be success and Git be a failure.

Di: Project Git got things accomplished with the user stories.

Wei: Prj Git wished they got their hands dirty.
   Now one group has experience Project Management and other group has
  experience in getting dirty.
    Now one group can rely on the other.

Di: Wants to ship the extension to everyone in class.
   Get practice on learning how to ship.

   Asssume we will do a presentation on Monday.

Nathan: Good controlled environment.


Wei: likes Di's idea b/c we get experience w/ maintainence.

Thomas: It touches on the practice of the deployment phase.

Nathan: its like a focus group.

Miguel: Are we suggesting presenting the Chirp extension?

Wei: Yes, but also deployment.


Thomas: Idea: Since prj Git is not done and we had a different style of
  iterations. Prj Git continues its iteration.
  Both subgroups are working a making progress forward.
  It allows us continue with our iteration style.

Wei & Di & Nathan & Miguel: Agree.

Nathan: Another week of expereience and we can do risk analysis later.


Josh: We formed tasks from the release planning draft.
  We need 10 hours together.

Di: Primary problem getting time together.

Wei: Divide into peer groups.

Josh: What's peer groups? is it like pairs?

Wei: Kind of.

Wei: AFter project Chirp finishes distribution to address the time issues.


Josh: Would we continue or help project Chirp?


Josh: To rest of the group: can we find time to meet?

Thomas: Can't do Sunday b/c of super bowl.

Wei: Offers his help. Free tomorrow.

Josh: Miguel can we match schedules?

Miguel: Saturday today and Tuesday.


Josh: Can we do this afternoon and Tuesdays afternoon.

Miguel: That works.

Josh: Ill send you guys a calendar invite.

Wei: Is willing to help.

Wei: Will deal with practicing, maintaining. and presenting in front of the

  class.

Thomas: One suggestion for Chirp: send an email to Jody and the class
  to take time for a presentation.

Wei & Di: Agree.

Wei: That would give them time to install BLuej

Nathan: We have 3 months left.

Meeting adjourned.

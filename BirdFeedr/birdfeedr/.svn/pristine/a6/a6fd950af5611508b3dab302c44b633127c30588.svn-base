Design Ideas
1. Where should exercises be saved?
- User chooses a location to save the exercise, since a new project will be created.
	(OR)
- User creates a new project, extension checks if it is empty so to populate it and not use 
	exisiting project.

2. How would the Java files be generated?
- XML file holds the name of the Java files that need to be created and the information 
	that will be in the files.
	(OR)
- Java files already generated with each exercise.

3. How will extension information be saved?
- Create a way to save all necessary information into the User BlueJ library folder.

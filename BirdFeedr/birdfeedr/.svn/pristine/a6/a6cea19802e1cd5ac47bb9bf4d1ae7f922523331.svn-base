Throughout our project we created multiple evolving designs about various aspects of the project.
We first made designs that addressed how the main project could be split into modules that we then 
could work on simultaneously. Then we worked on more detailed designs that addressed more specific 
functions of those modules. As the project's requirements evolved and unforeseen bugs appeared, 
our designs changed to address these changes. In the following section we have shown some of 
our various key designs to the project. Some designs represent how a feature or function currently 
works in BlueJ TA. Other designs show how features worked in earlier versions depicting the 
evolution of BlueJ TA.

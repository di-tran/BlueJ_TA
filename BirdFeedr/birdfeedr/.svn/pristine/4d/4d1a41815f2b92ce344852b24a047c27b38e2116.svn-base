Agenda:
 - Everybody reports.
 - Presentation.


Wei: Created an exercise class.
 description, title.

 Everyone of the exercises is an exercise object.
 Its easier.

 The controls show description and examples when the user selects.

 The right click does not show for every object.
 Right now it only shows up in exercise.
 For the future we may use packages to control the right click menu.

 Miguel created the execute and execute test.

   and exercise description.

 The execute test shows the test dialog.
 
 Its semi connected and we might have to use an lisener.

 Created the state manager.
  Miguel thought of and I implemented.
 Holds the state of the entire extension.
  If the guis have been initialized.

Di: Will execute run the test automatically?

Wei: I believe so.

Di: so the run button will rerun the test.

Di: so name it to "rerun"

Wei: that is a good idea.

Di: I see you all are using scene builder.

Wei: We have not implemented the compiler.

  The VM must be reset when we run it in BlueJ
  We believe that it is a problem wiht JavaFX.


Josh: What type of process model would you say this maps to?

Wei: Ideas and implementation.

Josh: Code and fix it.

Wei: there is also the prototyping we are doing.
  Design -> implement -> Demonstration

  Add pair programming, designs, small iterations.

Di: I have a link to the process model.

Josh: at this time, Wei and Miguel have went. Does that leave Nate?

Nate: I did not work on the GUI.
   Started to dev the v2 of JUnit runner.
   Concern: runner does not work in an infinite loop.
   I made a new process to run the test.
   The listener will notify the GUI when its completed.
   Use a socket to communicate b/t processes.

Josh: Was does not threading solve this problem?

Wei: the stop thread is deprecated and a security risk.
   This way you can stop bad code without killing BlueJ itself.
   This will be a lot of stuff to test.


Josh: How will this effect the maintainence overhead?

Nate: I will be trying to get the Maintainability lower
   For example, getting the BlueJ library folders.
   Version 2 only works with methods.

Josh: Will everything else be uploaded?

Nate: I will upload the latest version.

Wei: I will upload my state class.

   We did not test it in different OSs.
   I just uploaded.

Nate: I just uploaded as well.


Josh: 

Di: I would like to go over the structure.
   Similar to the Tiger Team presentation.
   Encourage the audience to use design patterns.
   First what it is and not.
   Next Types.
   Next specific types.
   We are not sure if this message is strong enough.

Wei: The message is not focused b/c of the three points.

Note: this 2nd time that thomas has not been at meeting
  and informed us.


Di: Work on the presentation and make sure it is in the a good state
  for our practice next time.

Di: Next Sat we can divy up parts.

Josh: Are we choosing this one.

Wei: I am okay with that.

Miguel: I am okay with that.

Nate: As long as we know what we are talking about.

Wei: I might do some reasoning.

   We used the Singleton in the State class.

   Its a global controler.
   A singleton is like th God class.


Wei: Want to persuade them to use a design pattern.

Di: When do want to think about design patterns.


Di: So we will meeting on Wednesday at 2 PM and discuss our message
 and research findings.


Di: Wednesday we can discuss our progress towards our designs.

Josh: On Wednesday, we can make the email and
  make sure that he has expecatations from the design.


Di: Iron triangle: scope, cost, and time
  Uses fidelity as well.
SOURCE:http://availagility.co.uk/2009/12/22/fidelity-the-lost-dimension-of-the-iron-triangle/

Di: Fidelity is quaility of the project.
  We were just developing things to get it to work.

Nate: the GUI is produced just to show the windows.
   Take a big block and refined like a sculpter.

Josh: Its like we are sculpting the project.
  I will be moving.

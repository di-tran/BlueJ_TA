Our product, BlueJ TA, is an extension for BlueJ that aids in the learning process by providing
programming exercises that students can fill in and receive real-time feedback. The following 
section mainly describes the elements that as a whole compose our product. Other than the BlueJ 
extension menus our project was mainly split into three major modules that: run JUnit test, 
read .xml files, and produce the graphical user interfaces. We also created some side auxiliary 
artifacts to aid the main project. Like sample exercise files to be shipped with the product 
and a build file to help with the cleaning and jaring of the product.

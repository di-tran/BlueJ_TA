The following artifact is the BlueJ TA extension our team developed. This product is composed of three main modules: the graphical user interfaces, the XML parser, and the JUnitRunner. This program was the outcome of a 16 week project for the CS 4260 course. This program is in a fully functional state, though there are some parts that were not fully implemented due to the short amount of time we had to complete the project.

As we chose to work on an extension for BlueJ,
but, we had not experience writing BlueJ extensions,
we thought that we needed to learn about how they worked.
Thus, we created two exploration projects:
Project Git and Project Chirp.
These projects helped us not only learn about BlueJ extensions,
but, gain confidence at writing them.

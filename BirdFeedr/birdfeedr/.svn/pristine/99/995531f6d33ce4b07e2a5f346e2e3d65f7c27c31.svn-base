DI: Discussion went the way it did b/c the fear to appease JP.
  Its a balancing act to keep him in the loop 
  Whatever we do we back it up.
  We talked about a process model to fit what we have done.

Josh: Why do we need the iterative model?

Di: Lets go back to build the extension

Josh: Maybe we failed to educate him on the process.

Wei: We were on the spot.

Wei: did we actually pick two process models

Di: we did. Our project picked iterative.

Di: We would pick one process model and stick w/ through the rest of the semester.

Thomas: I have been w/ companies that switch process models.

   His expectations are for us to pick a model and stick to it.

Di: We picked XP on the spot b/c we are afraid of meeting your expectations.
  Now that we think about it, we feel like this fits better.

THomas: what fits our time better?

Josh: Loosely define.

Di: Our project does not have to be completely done.

JP: Incremental and iterative is a good idea. That is what you have been doing.
  Get a little 

Josh: we expected that the the end of each of week we would have a product.

JP: Iterative you repeat the same steps.
    Incremental each previous peice is done.
    Using same process.

   What is an iteration?

Di: a set of features.

Josh: so we just promise something and deliver what we promise in time.

JP: The time is always an estimate as is the quality and the quantity.
  What if you come up short and what if you come up late?
  As soon as you get in the danger zone of missing that time
  then you let me know.
  Managing expectations.
  
SO then how you would manage the requirements
 How you will make those decisions and techniques is the model.
 You could the techniques of say XP.

  Choosing a named is useful for communications.
  But a model might be the right fit so you can say how you are modifying
  those.

Di: As long as we are telling you our characteristics.

JP: You know best who you are and what you do.


Thomas: is on file chooser.
Nate: Compiler.
Di: Process model.
Josh: Process model.

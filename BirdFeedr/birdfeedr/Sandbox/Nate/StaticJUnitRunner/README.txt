--StaticJUnitRunner README--

This is an initial static prototype version of a JUnit runner. An initial release of the 
extension could use this however this current version does not support stopping test 
and relies entirely on the calling thread which could be a problem when the code is executed 
with infinite loops or long methods created by the user.


*To execute without an ide(in the cmd or terminal):
Navigate to StaticJUnitRunner folder then:

compile with:
<path to JDK javac> -cp ".;junit-4.10.jar" *.java

run with:
<path to JDK java> -cp ".;junit-4.10.jar" StaticJUnitRunnerDemo



*To execute with an ide:
Import the 2 .java files into your ide and the "JUnitDemoCode.txt" and 
"UserDemoCode.txt" files into the projects local working directory to run there.
Note) the IDE will need the junit-4.10.jar in its library or buildpath as well to compile.

Our process model was informal, yet, it borrowed characteristics from popular process models such as XP, and the Spiral models. From XP, we borrowed the concepts of user stories, release planning, and throw away design metaphors. From the Spiral model, we borrowed the concept of prototypes. The purpose of the model was to think about real process models and how we related to them. It was also to help us gain direction on how we would create our project. The following artifact shows a graph of how our process model looked like in terms of fidelity, scope, and architecture.

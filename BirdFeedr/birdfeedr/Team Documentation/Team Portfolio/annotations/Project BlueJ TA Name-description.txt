The name of the extension we made was called BlueJ TA because of the main function of the
extension was to act as a teacher's assistant to help teacher teaches and students learn Java
within BlueJ. To come up with this name we applied a naming heuristic to eliminate and reform
various name ideas to decide the final product name. 

The following artifacts consist of the meeting notes that where taken during the name meeting.

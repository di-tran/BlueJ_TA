This collection of status reports sent to instructor and primary stakeholder, Dr. Jody Paul. Each status report contains weekly summarizations of team accomplishments and upcoming plans. These status reports were created because the team needed to communicated with the primary stakeholder in a consistent manner. By creating these status reports, an additional line of communication outside of class time was created between the team and the primary stakeholder.

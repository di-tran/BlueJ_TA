Project Chirp is a completed BlueJ extension that will cause BlueJ to play a chirping sound when a user compiles a file. Project Chirp was an exploration project that allowed the team to learn more about the BlueJ API and creating BlueJ extensions. During this project, the team learned several interesting quirks about BlueJ. For instance, we learned that BlueJ will store files in different locations depending on the OS. We also discovered that BlueJ provides CompileEvents and CompileListeners in their API. The following artifact consists of an exploration summary of what we learned while creating this extension.

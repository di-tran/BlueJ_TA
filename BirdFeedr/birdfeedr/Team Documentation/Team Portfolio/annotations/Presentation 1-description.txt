Presentation one talked about our experience with pair programming.
We started the presentation by defining pari programming.
Next, we used our experiences to talk about different pair programming scenarios.
Specifically, we created a skit to show good and bad programming pairs
of three types: expert-expert, expert-novice, and novice-novice.
We have included slides(s) from the presentation below.

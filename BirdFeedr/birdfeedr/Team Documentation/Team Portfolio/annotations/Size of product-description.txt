The following artifact shows the number of classes within the BlueJ TA project as well as how many lines of code are in each class and the project as a whole. We created this artifact because we wanted another metric to show how much work was done on the project. The artifact is a text file containing the classes, the number of lines of codes in each class, and the total number of lines of code for the project.

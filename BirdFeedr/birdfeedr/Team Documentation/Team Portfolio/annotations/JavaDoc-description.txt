The BlueJ TA project utilizes Java Doc to describe key aspects of the program
and how it functions. Where Java doc is a standard documentation format to add documentation

add this documentation to our code to help increase the understandability of our project 
with the added compatibility of backed in documentation.

The following artifacts consists some samples of the Java doc for BlueJ TA.

BlueJ TA used a total of three different graphical user interfaces coded using JavaFX. 
Where the first was used to allow a user to pick their exercise, the second 
was used to display descriptive info about an exercise to the user, and the third 
was used to deliver test results to the user after execution of an exercise.

We decided to use JavaFx to create these GUI's because of the ease of creation with 
the tools available as well as the ease of maintained of the code. We arrived at three distinct
GUI's with one feature per GUI because it seemed in-line with BlueJ's design nature.

The following artifacts consists of three images showing the three different 
windows used within BlueJ TA.

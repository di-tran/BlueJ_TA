Team metrics came from a variety of sources
like lines of code and logged time.
This data was processed into reports
for the purpose of presenting this information in our note book.
Specifically for logged time,
our group created metrics by logging the time that we spent by category.
This data was recorded online in our Redmine project management tool.

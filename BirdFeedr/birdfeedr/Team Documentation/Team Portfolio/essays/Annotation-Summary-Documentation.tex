Documentation helps us communicate with future developers and remember key aspects about our project.
We created documentation in a number of areas: a team vision, a project definition document, READMEs, source code Java Docs, etc.
Our team vision describes the shared dream of our team.
It was used to keep us going the same direction and to verify that our decisions were appropriate.
Our project definition describes our project mission and what we were trying to accomplish.
Our READMEs provide a number of features like explaining the directory structure of our project and how to install our extension.
The source code documentation helps us remember how the code works, and also informs future developers should they choose to develop our project and learn about our code.

Our group went through an iterative and incremental process
and we tried to follow what we learned about process models
from the previous course.
Our actual process borrowed characteristics from various process models.
For examples,
we used XP's concept of user stories and throw away models.
For another example,
we used the Spiral's model concept of prototyping
to manage design risks.

When we chose to work on an extension for BlueJ,
we realized the team had no experience writing BlueJ extensions.
We decided that we needed to learn about how they worked.
Thus, we created two exploration projects:
Project Git and Project Chirp.
These projects helped us not only learn about BlueJ extensions,
but also gain confidence at writing them.

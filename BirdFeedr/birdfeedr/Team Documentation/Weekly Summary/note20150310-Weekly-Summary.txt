Monday
 - JP announces that he would like to see deliverables from
    each group since we were all agile. He said as agile
    we should always have something running.
 - He wanted to be able to build our repository from its source.
 - Our group failed to have something ready to show him. This happened
   because we did not even have our first iteration complete so
   of course there was nothing to show.
 - He went through our repository and told us that it was not ready
   or in a ready state.
 - Since he is our primary stake holder, we have devoted human resources
   to making the repository better organized and documented.

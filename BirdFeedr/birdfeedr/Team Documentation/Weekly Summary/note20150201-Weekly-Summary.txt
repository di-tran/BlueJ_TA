Major Decisions:

Chirp switches to the deployment stage.

Project Git continues with Release and Iteration planning.

Josh, Miguel will try to match schedules Sat, Mon, Tue, Wed.



Major problems:

Project Git did make much progress, but, that is probably
 because there was not time for team members to work together.

  We will try to solve this by setting up time to work together.


What we learned:

  The most progress was made outside of class for project chirp.
  Project Git learned alot about the DXP Process model.

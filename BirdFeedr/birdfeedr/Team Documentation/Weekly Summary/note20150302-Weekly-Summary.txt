Fourth week of February:
  -We gave a presentation on Wednesday.
  -We presented our list of ideas to JP before the end of class.
    --The first idea for an interpretter is already implemented in BlueJ.
  -ON Wednesday, Wei and Miguel surveyed students and computer science teachers.
  -On Friday, Josh surveyed students and got feedback on project ideas.
  -On Sunday, we discussed the results of the surveys and tried to pick a project.
    --We agreed to not make a decision yet and send our list of student supported ideas
      to JP.
    --Depending on what he says, we will create will create prootypes to show the students
       one Wendesday.

I learned that team members get impatient when we don't get moving on a project.

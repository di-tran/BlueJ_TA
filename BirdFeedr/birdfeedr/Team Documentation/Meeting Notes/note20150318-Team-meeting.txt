JP Talked to faculty about ext.
 Expected to hear of:
  - Coding bat.
     -- does a great job with method level problems with a self contained
        context.
  - Practice it.

Liked be able to not sign in.

Practice it had better problems.


Value to a bluej would be integration w/ IDE as intended.
  - Full class
  - Multiple class.
  - Imports
  - Javadoc.
  - Surrounded framework could be provided.


Using inner nest classes to do this.

STill doing the same problems but through the IDE


Wei: It was hard to guess how to integrate.
   Moved the run button.

Multiple listboxes in GUI vs Multiple questions.

 and also no GUI for the question.


Wei: Some of his colleges expectations might be out of scope.

Josh: What does it look like and what does it do?
  Maybe we could divide into groups and do presentations.
  and when we get back we could change.

Josh: I got two close to be done.

Josh: Propose.
  Our project could produce the class files with the problems.
  and a dialog showing the results of a test.

  What will you do and what do you need.

Wei: needs the parser code and compiler code.
   Thomas needs to upload his code by Sat meeting.
   Nate needs eventually upload his code eventually.
   Something in the middle that loads up everything in a folder.
   
   We will have a folder with exercises that we will be loading files.
    We might also have this in the repository.
    So it might need a link and a subfolder.

  Three people on the 

Thomas: Lets do one Wednesday next week.

Saturday's agenda:
 - Roundtable report.
 - Presentation practice.


Decisions:
 - Committed to making a product that produces the source code and
   checks the student's owkr.

Delegation:
 - Di, Josh will be working on the presentation.
 - Nate, Thomas, Miguel, and Wei will do coding.


JP Comments:
  It might be okay if were navigational or code editting.
  Users learning a new interface could take away from blueJ.

We present on Wednesday.

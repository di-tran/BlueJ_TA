Picking our extensions.

Redmine Workflow.
Where to put what.

Dinner Feb 10, 5:30 pm

Wei: Refactoring. Small ext. Easy to maintain.
  Suggestions/analysis and refactoring.
  Support a small subset of refactoring.

Miguel: version control.

Thomas: do a small extension to begin with to give our team a quick
  success. We could do another extension.

Thomas: slightly easier -- ext further languages. Why? Env setup.
  Linux has native support for c++. WIndows does not.
Josh: IDE does not allow opening other files types.
Thomas: The lang tools are out their.

Nate: Visualization. What's on the stack, heap, garbage collection.
      Visualize multithreading deadlocks.
      IT would help people in BlueJ learn.

Di: Simulation also. Harder, but, more helpful.

Josh: Clojure IDE got shutdown.
   Refactoring was feasible.
   Like gen automation testing.
   Like simulation.

Everyone likes the idea of starting with an easy project.

Thomas: clean room dev. Find a bug start all over.

  COT -- specialized XML made by the military.

Wei: asks the other team for help.

Thomas: everyone can be more involved.

JP Loves the agile approach to get something done.
  Choose a small set of features like copy n paste detector.

Scoping the project down to what is doable.

Think of a small increment.

Like the idea of working in parrallel b/c you could learn more.

Di: Chirp.

Thomas: Git is on the table.
  Just commit.

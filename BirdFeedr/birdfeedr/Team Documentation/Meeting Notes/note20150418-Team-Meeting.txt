UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

TO DO
- Schedule presentation work time between now and Monday, rehearse Monday.

RAW NOTES
Presentation is in two parts: process & project.

M: When is the JUnit test being executed?
N: Check Exercise class for execute method.
M: Exercise not launched. Is it even being called?

J: Javadoc shouldn’t be stored in repo. 
M: I’m working on javadoc in the source code.

J: Make sure errors must be noted. If it’s graded right now, I say it deserves a C. What’s most important is the individual portfolios. So by Monday we should start shifting gears.
We should get our presentation cranked out too.

W: I originally planned for it to be done on Monday so we could rehearse M/W. 

N: Proj. Notebook & Final Presentation can be worked on simultaneously.
W: Would assist each other. Proj. notebook helps final presentation.

J: Monday: .5 hours rehearse
1 - 1.5 hours project prep / inv. portfolio prep.

J: I’m using LaTeX.
J: Permission to heavily modify build in Nate’s sandbox? I want build file to create jar & move it in extension folder. BlueJ would be responsible for compiling src and stuff. 
This is b/c it takes extra time for build to compile.
N: Whole point of build is as an alternative to BlueJ.
J: BlueJ should be doing more of the work.

W: Story or standard intro?
T: Story will draw audience in.
W: Vision statement is broad; mission statement is the how. 1st half of our statement IS vision statement, mission statement includes all of it. We could tell audience the difference between the two.

W: Does our audience know enough that we can skip the vision statement?
N: I think they created a vision statement, but I’m not sure.
T: Err on the safe side.

W: Do we want key message to be about vision statement or mission statements?
We created a mission statement, but called it a vision statement
J: Keep the focus on our personal experience, and deliver pertinent information to keep people on track, and focus on how it will help the audience.

W: If we put information in the handout, we won’t have enough info to talk about.

W: Refactor team meeting notes?
